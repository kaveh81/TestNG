<p>14. <u>Dual-Media Software</u>. You may receive the Software in more than one medium (electronic and on a CD, for example).

<p>24. <u>Entire Agreement</u>.  This Agreement constitutes the complete and entire understanding and agreement of all terms, conditions and representations between you and Licensor with respect to the Software and may be modified only in writing by both parties.  No term or condition contained in your purchase order will apply unless expressly accepted by Licensor in writing.
