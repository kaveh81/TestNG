Archived are the zip files for cobertura 1.9.4.1. There is a zip for the binary distribution and one that includes source.
There is also a .hpi file which is a zip of the cobertura plugin for Hudson which is installed in Hudson for generating
the coverage reports.

For using cobertura you only need to unzip the binary file somewhere and reference it in your build.
