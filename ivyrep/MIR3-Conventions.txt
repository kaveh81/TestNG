Conventions for MIR3 Ivy Repository:

All Ivy files must contain the license property.  License names are lower-cased.

Organization names are derived from domain names, so the Organization name for Apache is org.apache,
the organization name for Sun is com.sun, etc.

The "default" configuration should contain only the binary jar and jars required at runtime.

The "distribution" configuration should contain the complete distribution from the maintainer.  If
the distribution is split into "src" and "bin" versions, as many are, the repository should contain both.
The naming convention for distributions with src and bin versions is:
	[artifact]-src-[revision].[ext]
for example:
	commons-codec-bin-1.3.tar.gz
